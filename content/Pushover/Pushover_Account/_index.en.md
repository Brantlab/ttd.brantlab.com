## Setting up pushover account

Head over to [https://pushover.net/signup ](https://pushover.net/signup) and sign up for a free account

1. Once you have an account created I would then create an application. 
2. Give your application a name
3. Upload a nice logo for your application 
4. Accept the terms and conditions
5. Click "Create Application"
6. Note down the API Token/Key as you will need this later
    <br> Should look like this `axtzfru5##########17vcejpmnwv6` Just note I blotched out 10 charcters
7. Go back to main account page and get your User Key and note it down as you will need this as well
8. Go to next chapter

* Just a design note you can either run all your departments through 1 API token or you can create multiple applications for each department and allow you to more choose what you or others would like alerts on.
